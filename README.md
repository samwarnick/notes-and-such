# Notes and Such About Things and Stuff

This is/will be my collection of notes, tips, tricks and various technologies. Always and forever a WIP. I often learn things and promptly forget them because I don't write them down anywhere. So hopefully this will help remedy that.

See a mistake or know of a better way to do something? Let me know by creating an issue, opening a PR, or hitting me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samwarnick). :smile:
